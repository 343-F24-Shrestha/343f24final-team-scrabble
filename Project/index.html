            <h1>Scrabble Solver</h1>
            <h3 id="about">About</h3>
            <p>This is a 'solver' for the popular, family-game-night board game <cite>Scrabble</cite>. This game
                originally made in 1948 by James Brunot was initially unsuccessful until the president of the
                <cite>Macy's</cite> department store at the time tried it on vacation. After that the game was ordered
                in huge sums. Brunot, now unable to keep up with the large demand sold the manufacuring rights to a
                larger company in 1952, which is how it evloved into the well known game played worldwide today.
            </p>

            <p>This 'solver' is a may for players to figure out the best possible moves in a game of
                <cite>Scrabble</cite> at any time. This is a project made for an Application Development course (CS343)
                at James Madison University (JMU). In a group we worked together to form a helpful tool for all players.
            </p>
            <h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
            <p>This 'solver' has many purposes. To be clear this was not created as a way for people to cheat in
                <cite>Scrabble</cite>. Though we do see the likeliness of this happening to be very high, the tool was
                originally made for other reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To check your score against the best best score to see what areas of your game need work.</li>
                <li>To practice against a computer in a way by placing tiles according to the best possible moves from a
                    seperate tile set to yor own.</li>
                <li>The most likely reason, to beat that one friend who is really good at <cite>Words With
                        Friends</cite>.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h3>
